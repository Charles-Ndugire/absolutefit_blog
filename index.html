                        <p>Here are 5 free tips to boost your fitness</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Get outside as much as possible.</li>
                        <li>Keep your workouts interesting.</li>
                        <li>Walk in a new way. </li>
                        <li>Exercise using your body weight.</li>
                        <li>Join the kids.</li>
                        <p>
                        <em>Get outside as much as possible.</em> Unless your area is under a stay-at-home order or you need to remain in quarantine, try to exercise outside as much as possible. Take a walk, jog, or ride a bike outside, just remember to wear a mask and/or maintain a safe distance from others. The fresh air and sunshine will provide a further boost to your mental health.

                        <em>Keep your workouts interesting.</em> Watch your favorite streaming show or listen to a podcast or some great music while working out. While walking, explore a new area in your neighborhood or catch up with a friend on the phone to keep things from getting stale. Or try activity video games or “exergames” that simulate dancing, skateboarding, soccer, bowling, or tennis. These can be great alternatives if you’re unable to participate in the real thing at the moment.
                          
                        <em>Walk in a new way.</em> Immerse yourself in the full experience of walking outdoors by adding a mindfulness element. Notice the smell of the air, the variety of flowers and trees and the feel of the sun or the wind as you move. Bringing your attention to these things can give your conscious mind a break from your worries and unleash your creativity. You might find new ideas and solutions coming to you when you weren’t even aware you were working on them. If you find you need to up the intensity of your walks, look for hills, do some step ups on the curb at each corner, skip, or even jump up and down the curb a few times (if appropriate for your fitness level and joints).
                          
                        <em>Exercise using your body weight</em>Using your own body weight with a circuit-type program can be an effective way to maintain strength and aerobic health in a short period of time. Bodyweight workouts can incorporate a variety of movements that don’t require equipment, including: 
                        <ul>
                          <li>Burpees</li>
                          <li>Squats</li>
                          <li>Lunges</li>
                          <li>Pushups</li>
                        </ul>
                          
                          <em>Join the kids.</em> Play catch or tag, go for a bike ride, shoot baskets, or pass the soccer ball with your kids. Taking the focus away from schoolwork or chores and playing together can even help repair a strained relationship.</p>
